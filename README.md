# Dotfiles

This repository can be used to create a fully working development environment Ã  la MapManagement
style. I'm currently using Arch and i3 as my foundation.
[My Arch guide](https://github.com/MapManagement/dotfiles/blob/master/guides/arch_guide.md) explains the
whole installation. To easen the process of setting up the machine after the base installation, I
created an Ansible playbook to automate the installation and following configuration/customization
of every package I need.
