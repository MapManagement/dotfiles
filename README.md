# Dotfiles

All my configuration files are stored within this repository. If you want to see my whole setup you
need to visit [this one](https://github.com/MapManagement/dev-setup). It also includes an Ansible
playbook to automatically install and configure all packages that I use. When executing mentioned
playbook, it'll copy the whole repository and apply the stored configuration files.
