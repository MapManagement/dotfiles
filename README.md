# Dotfiles

This repository can be used to create a fully working development environment Ã  la MapManagement
style. I'm currently using Arch and i3 as my foundation.
[My Arch guide](https://github.com/MapManagement/dotfiles/blob/master/guides/arch_guide.md) explains the
whole installation. To easen the process of setting up the machine after the base installation, I
created an Ansible playbook to automate the installation and following configuration/customization
of every package I need.

To start the installation process, simply just start the ``setup_machine.py`` script. It is going to
ask you some stuff about the purpose of the machine. Your answers impact some tasks of the playbook.

## VFIO

My main machine uses vfio to pass a graphics card to specific virtual machines. Thus I can play
games flawlessly in a Windows environment. Using Ansible, my configuration of setting up vfio
on an Arch based system, didn't seem to be that easy. Therefore I decided to do this manually
everytime I have to install a fresh Arch installation on my desktop machine. My guide can be found
[here](https://github.com/MapManagement/gpu-passthrough).
